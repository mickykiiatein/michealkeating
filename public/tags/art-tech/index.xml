      <description>Installation of Media Works for the 40th EVA International Biennial Exhibition&#xA;I worked as part of the EVA Intl install team, handling file preparation and installation of ~30 sound and video based works for their 40th Biennial. This included the guest programme The Gleaners Society, curated by Sebastian Cichocki, as well as the EVA Platform Commissions. It was a fantastic experience working with the EVA Intl team, and playing part in installing a large scale exhibition.</description>
