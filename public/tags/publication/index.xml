      <description>Self-published artist book, 60 pages&#xA;TERRA is a personal exploration of the image culture of &amp;lsquo;Ireland&amp;rsquo;s largest motor and classifieds website&amp;rsquo; DoneDeal.ie. As the author becomes engrossed by found imagery of cars, farm machinery, animals and land for sale â€“ themes of rural ireland, agriculture, landscape and regional identity transpire. Given some attention, DoneDeal emerges as an intriguing living document of rural Ireland, as depicted incidentally by its own inhabitants. The publication has been stocked in The Library Project, Dublin, as well as visiting Tsundoku Art Book Fair (Dublin), DISTRO (Cavan Arts Festival), Limerick Zine Fest, Rebel Reads (Cork) and The Ecliptic Newsstand.</description>
