      <description>Sound, Video, Photography, Sizes &amp;amp; Durations variable (2023-ongoing)&#xA;This work is an ongoing engagement with rural Limerick landscapes, combining deep listening, improvised sound-making, field recording and photography/videography. I perform this ritual with voice and electronics in local landscapes of varying land use (including peat bogs, industrial plants, dairy farmland, quarries, commercial forestry plantations), weaving with their sonic ecologies. I document this ritual with sound and video recording, and I document the landscapes with medium format photography.</description>

      <description>Single channel video with sound, 8.5mins&#xA;Sound Performance exploring stereotypical imagery of Irish landscapes. Images are pulled from a Google search of &amp;lsquo;Ireland&amp;rsquo;. The performance draws out an uncanny sense of Ireland as viewed by Google users. The idealised landscapes shown are undercut by a mangled voice, suggesting that all is not as quaint and bucolic as it seems in the rural Irish landscape. Initially published as an Instagram reel.</description>

      <description>Sound performance with single channel video projection, 30mins&#xA;Grasslands&amp;rsquo; was a 30 minute improvised sound performance for the opening of STARLING arts space, Limerick. I performed with voice, signal processing, and field recording, incorporating foraged and AI-generated text relating Irish agricultural grasslands. A durational video projection of a sunset over County Limerick grasslands underpins the performance.</description>

      <description>Single channel video loop with sound (63mins), website-based text, and QR code installation&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Stare at the Landscape’ is a multimedia meditation on landscape – our relationship with it, the memory embodied in it, and the futurity potential in it. The work features a 63 minute single channel video of Limerick landscapes shot over a 15-month period, sound, and a web-based stream-of-consciousness text piece which viewers can access through their own devices using a QR code.</description>

      <description>Single channel HD video with sound, 36.5mins&#xA;A 36 minute audiovisual artwork completed for my MA thesis, in which large volumes of digital archival materials pertaining to Limerick are combined with footage of the Limerick landscape, to explore the land as a haunted, digitally mediated palimpsest. The piece probes questions of memory, place, hauntology, nostalgia, historical narratives, temporality and the digital archive. The piece was exhibited in &amp;lsquo;The Limerick Show&amp;rsquo; (2022) in Ormston House.</description>

      <title>Home Video (1993-2003)</title>

      <description>CRT Video Installation with sound, variable duration&#xA;‘Home Video 1993-2003’ is an audiovisual installation piece in which my family&amp;rsquo;s home VHS tapes are digitally processed and juxtaposed by a generative algorithm in realtime, and displayed on my family&amp;rsquo;s old disused CRT TV. Different times layer and blur into one another – chronology is thrown into disarray, and time becomes out of joint. The sentimental nostalgia of the home video viewing experience is abstracted, the familiarity of it is altered, in order to allow an eerie agency of time to present itself.</description>
