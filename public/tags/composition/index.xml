      <description>Composition, Production, Mix, Guitar, Bass, Synth, Drum Programming, Violin, Accordion&#xA;Hear it on Bandcamp&#xA;Original Score for Féile na Gréine&amp;rsquo;s documentary film &amp;lsquo;Out of Place&amp;rsquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This is a pinhole view capturing a passing moment. The story is neither polished or neat, it is rough and taped together at the seams, fragmented and utterly incomplete.&#xA;Featuring performances from Denise Chaila, God Knows, Hey Rusty, His Father’s Voice, MuRli, and Post Punk Podge &amp;amp; the Technohippies, OUT OF PLACE is an intimate portrayal of a local music scene, capturing the incredible diversity of cultural activity happening in Limerick City.</description>

The piece fixates on hauntings as virtual (non)presences, which can have persistent agency from a distant time or place.</description>

      <description>Composition&#xA;Musical Score for Network-Connected Guitar Ensemble&#xA;‘Un Separate’ is a musical concept sketch for an improvisational electric guitar ensemble scattered throughout Limerick city centre. I conceived the piece during lockdown in April 2020 while trying to imagine ways which Limerick could experience live music once again, in a time where concerts have become an impossibility. Performers are located in various venues throughout the city centre, and though they are far apart and cannot hear each other, the improvisational structures they perform within are synchronised by timed visual cues to be delivered to each performer’s phone or personal device via network.</description>
