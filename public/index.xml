      <description>I am a sound artist from County Limerick working with voice and electroacoustic sound performance, field recording, landscape videography and photography, audiovisual programming, found internet media, and writing. I combine these modes in immersive work that probes the relationships between humans, technology, memory, ecology and landscape, often in a distinctly rural Limerick context. My upbringing on a dairy farm heavily informs my work, leading to a focus on agriculture, land use and ownership.</description>

      <description>Sound, Video, Photography, Sizes &amp;amp; Durations variable (2023-ongoing)&#xA;This work is an ongoing engagement with rural Limerick landscapes, combining deep listening, improvised sound-making, field recording and photography/videography. I perform this ritual with voice and electronics in local landscapes of varying land use (including peat bogs, industrial plants, dairy farmland, quarries, commercial forestry plantations), weaving with their sonic ecologies. I document this ritual with sound and video recording, and I document the landscapes with medium format photography.</description>

      <description>Single channel video with sound, 8.5mins&#xA;Sound Performance exploring stereotypical imagery of Irish landscapes. Images are pulled from a Google search of &amp;lsquo;Ireland&amp;rsquo;. The performance draws out an uncanny sense of Ireland as viewed by Google users. The idealised landscapes shown are undercut by a mangled voice, suggesting that all is not as quaint and bucolic as it seems in the rural Irish landscape. Initially published as an Instagram reel.</description>

      <description>Self-published artist book, 60 pages&#xA;TERRA is a personal exploration of the image culture of &amp;lsquo;Ireland&amp;rsquo;s largest motor and classifieds website&amp;rsquo; DoneDeal.ie. As the author becomes engrossed by found imagery of cars, farm machinery, animals and land for sale – themes of rural ireland, agriculture, landscape and regional identity transpire. Given some attention, DoneDeal emerges as an intriguing living document of rural Ireland, as depicted incidentally by its own inhabitants. The publication has been stocked in The Library Project, Dublin, as well as visiting Tsundoku Art Book Fair (Dublin), DISTRO (Cavan Arts Festival), Limerick Zine Fest, Rebel Reads (Cork) and The Ecliptic Newsstand.</description>

The work combines contemporary technology with ancient ritualism to strive for an other-worldly techno-pagan utopia where humans, technology and nature co-exist in a sensitive and caring partnership.</description>

      <description>CRT Video Installation with sound, variable duration&#xA;‘Home Video 1993-2003’ is an audiovisual installation piece in which my family&amp;rsquo;s home VHS tapes are digitally processed and juxtaposed by a generative algorithm in realtime, and displayed on my family&amp;rsquo;s old disused CRT TV. Different times layer and blur into one another – chronology is thrown into disarray, and time becomes out of joint. The sentimental nostalgia of the home video viewing experience is abstracted, the familiarity of it is altered, in order to allow an eerie agency of time to present itself.</description>

      <description>Composition&#xA;Musical Score for Network-Connected Guitar Ensemble&#xA;‘Un Separate’ is a musical concept sketch for an improvisational electric guitar ensemble scattered throughout Limerick city centre. I conceived the piece during lockdown in April 2020 while trying to imagine ways which Limerick could experience live music once again, in a time where concerts have become an impossibility. Performers are located in various venues throughout the city centre, and though they are far apart and cannot hear each other, the improvisational structures they perform within are synchronised by timed visual cues to be delivered to each performer’s phone or personal device via network.</description>

      <description>Concept, Direction, Generative Visuals, Editing&#xA;Watch Here&#xA;An interactive VR music video that I made under the restrictions of strict COVID-19 lockdown in May 2020.

The viewer is surrounded with abstract construction in the VR world, echoing the songs lyrical themes of confinement and entrapment.</description>
