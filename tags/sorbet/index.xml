      <description>Concept, Director, Videography, Visual Algorithms, Editing&#xA;Watch Here&#xA;A music video I made which reflects the song’s anthropocene theme in an understated, locally-specific way. Generative computational techniques are utilised to collage video clips of various processes of exchange and energy transfer, and these images are brought into dialogue with the Limerick/Tipperary landscape, to inspire reflection on human processes and their cumulative impact on the local landscape. I also contributed lyrics and vocals to the song under the pseudonym ‘mickykiiatein’.</description>

      <description>Songwriting, Lead Vocals, Additional Instrumentation&#xA;Hear it on Bandcamp&#xA;Collaborative track with Chris Ryan (Robocobra Quartet) which appeared on the album &amp;lsquo;This Was Paradise&amp;rsquo; by his project SORBET. The album deals with themes of ecological breakdown and also features contributions from Maija Sofia, Arborist and others. I wrote lyrics for the song which were inspired by an experience of watching a cow die from milk fever.</description>
