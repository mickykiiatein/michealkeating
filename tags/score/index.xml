      <description>Composition&#xA;Musical Score for Network-Connected Guitar Ensemble&#xA;‘Un Separate’ is a musical concept sketch for an improvisational electric guitar ensemble scattered throughout Limerick city centre. I conceived the piece during lockdown in April 2020 while trying to imagine ways which Limerick could experience live music once again, in a time where concerts have become an impossibility. Performers are located in various venues throughout the city centre, and though they are far apart and cannot hear each other, the improvisational structures they perform within are synchronised by timed visual cues to be delivered to each performer’s phone or personal device via network.</description>
