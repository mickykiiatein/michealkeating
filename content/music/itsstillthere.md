‘It’s Still There’ is a 10 minute instrumental piece by Mícheál Keating and drummer Brendan McInerney of Bleeding Heart Pigeons, commissioned by The Source Arts Centre, Thurles. The track marries elements of Progressive Rock, Drum-and-Bass, Electronic, Free Jazz, and Ambient music. The piece fixates on hauntings as virtual (non)presences, which can have persistent agency from a distant time or place. My roles in the piece included composition, production, mixing, tape loops, vocals, guitars, bass, synthesizers, viola and flute.

_The track was named the #1 Irish Track of 2021 by The Thin Air magazine, and was reviewed in a feature on Irish underground music in The Quietus magazine."_
