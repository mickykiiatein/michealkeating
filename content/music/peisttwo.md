The second album by improvised music collective Péist

"Péist (transl. worm) are a group of musicians and artists based in Limerick. In their improvisations, they wriggle and writhe between sounds and musical forms, burrowing through the dirt.

Peíst are Mícheál Keating, Daithí Mac Cruitín, Eilis Mahon, Cian McGuirk, Caimin Walsh and Aoibhinn O'Dea"	Improviser (vocals, guitar and signal processing)
