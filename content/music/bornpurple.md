Collaborative track with Chris Ryan (Robocobra Quartet) which appeared on the album 'This Was Paradise' by his project SORBET. The album deals with themes of ecological breakdown and also features contributions from Maija Sofia, Arborist and others. I wrote lyrics for the song which were inspired by an experience of watching a cow die from milk fever.
