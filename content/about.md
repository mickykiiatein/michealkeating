I am a sound artist from County Limerick working with voice and electroacoustic sound performance, field recording, landscape videography and photography, audiovisual programming, found internet media, and writing. I combine these modes in immersive work that probes the relationships between humans, technology, memory, ecology and landscape, often in a distinctly rural Limerick context. My upbringing on a dairy farm heavily informs my work, leading to a focus on agriculture, land use and ownership.

From 2008-2020, I was lead singer/songwriter and producer of the band Bleeding Heart Pigeons, releasing critically acclaimed albums both with Virgin Records UK and as an independent act. In 2019, I earned an MA in Art and Technology in the University of Limerick, establishing a multimedia art practice. I am involved in creative communities in Limerick City as a musician (Péist, Laura Duff, The Low Field), freelance music producer and media art tech, festival organiser with Féile na Gréine, and artist-in-residence at Ormston House. My engagement in these different areas feeds into a practice that intersects art, music and technology.

Available for commissions and collaborations.
