An interactive VR music video that I made under the restrictions of strict COVID-19 lockdown in May 2020. Old footage of the band was recycled and combined with algorithmic visuals to create something new. The viewer is surrounded with abstract construction in the VR world, echoing the songs lyrical themes of confinement and entrapment.
