A music video I made which reflects the song’s anthropocene theme in an understated, locally-specific way. Generative computational techniques are utilised to collage video clips of various processes of exchange and energy transfer, and these images are brought into dialogue with the Limerick/Tipperary landscape, to inspire reflection on human processes and their cumulative impact on the local landscape. I also contributed lyrics and vocals to the song under the pseudonym ‘mickykiiatein’.
