*Sound, Video, Photography, Sizes & Durations variable (2023-ongoing)* 

This work is an ongoing engagement with rural Limerick landscapes, combining deep listening, improvised sound-making, field recording and photography/videography. I perform this ritual with voice and electronics in local landscapes of varying land use (including peat bogs, industrial plants, dairy farmland, quarries, commercial forestry plantations), weaving with their sonic ecologies. I document this ritual with sound and video recording, and I document the landscapes with medium format photography.

This practice gives rise to meditations on what it means to be a rural Irish person amidst increasingly neoliberalised and over-extracted landscapes. Contemplating the metamorphosis of land over time and the powers that haunt this process, these pieces often externalise a mixture of feelings including ecological grief, fear, political anger and longing for alternative futures.
