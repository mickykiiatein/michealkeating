*Single channel video loop with sound (63mins), website-based text, and QR code installation*

'Stare at the Landscape’ is a multimedia meditation on landscape – our relationship with it, the memory embodied in it, and the futurity potential in it. The work features a 63 minute single channel video of Limerick landscapes shot over a 15-month period, sound, and a web-based stream-of-consciousness text piece which viewers can access through their own devices using a QR code. The piece was exhibited at Concept Null's group exhibition in The Boat Club, Limerick in September 2021.
