*CRT Video Installation with sound, variable duration*

‘Home Video 1993-2003’ is an audiovisual installation piece in which my family's home VHS tapes are digitally processed and juxtaposed by a generative algorithm in realtime, and displayed on my family's old disused CRT TV. Different times layer and blur into one another – chronology is thrown into disarray, and time becomes out of joint. The sentimental nostalgia of the home video viewing experience is abstracted, the familiarity of it is altered, in order to allow an eerie agency of time to present itself. The sound and visuals produced are slowly ever-changing due to the generative nature of the algorithm’s design.
