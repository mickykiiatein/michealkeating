Sound Performance exploring stereotypical imagery of Irish landscapes. Images are pulled from a Google search of 'Ireland'. The performance draws out an uncanny sense of Ireland as viewed by Google users. The idealised landscapes shown are undercut by a mangled voice, suggesting that all is not as quaint and bucolic as it seems in the rural Irish landscape. Initially published as an Instagram reel.
