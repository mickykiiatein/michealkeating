*Sound performance with single channel video projection, 30mins*

Grasslands' was a 30 minute improvised sound performance for the opening of STARLING arts space, Limerick. I performed with voice, signal processing, and field recording, incorporating foraged and AI-generated text relating Irish agricultural grasslands. A durational video projection of a sunset over County Limerick grasslands underpins the performance.
