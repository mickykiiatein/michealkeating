*Audiovisual interspecies performance and sculptural hanging installation, variable duration*

‘Interspecies Ensemble" is an interdisciplinary live gallery performance that stages an intimate and ritualistic encounter between humans, plants and digital life. Human and plant actors, electroacoustic sounds and visual projections interact in a sensory ecology from which an improvised musical, theatrical and audiovisual performance emerges. The work combines contemporary technology with ancient ritualism to strive for an other-worldly techno-pagan utopia where humans, technology and nature co-exist in a sensitive and caring partnership. A transnational collaboration project - the piece experimentally combines the different practices of the three artists in the fields of performance, music, animation, film, digital art and installation. 

The piece was commissioned by the Irish Embassy in Berlin and performed at the Kunstzentrum Karlkaserne, Ludwigsburg, Germany, for Raumwelten Festival in November 2021.
