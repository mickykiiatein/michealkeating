A 36 minute audiovisual artwork completed for my MA thesis, in which large volumes of digital archival materials pertaining to Limerick are combined with footage of the Limerick landscape, to explore the land as a haunted, digitally mediated palimpsest. The piece probes questions of memory, place, hauntology, nostalgia, historical narratives, temporality and the digital archive. The piece was exhibited in 'The Limerick Show' (2022) in Ormston House.
