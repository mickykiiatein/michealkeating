_Installation of Media Works for the [40th EVA International Biennial Exhibition](https://www.eva.ie/biennial/40th-eva-international/)_

I worked as part of the EVA Intl install team, handling file preparation and installation of ~30 sound and video based works for their 40th Biennial. This included the guest programme The Gleaners Society, curated by Sebastian Cichocki, as well as the EVA Platform Commissions. It was a fantastic experience working with the EVA Intl team, and playing part in installing a large scale exhibition.
