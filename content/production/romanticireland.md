_Venice Biennale Multimedia Installation_

_Production Team, Technical Consultant, File Management/Archivist_ 

Eimear Walshe's multimodal piece ['Romantic Ireland'](https://www.labiennale.org/en/art/2024/ireland) was produced to represent Ireland at the 2024 Venice Biennale Arte. I worked as part of the project's production team, as a shoot assistant for a test shoot, as well as file management/archivist for the project's video shoots.
