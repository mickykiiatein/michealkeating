[**Hear it on Bandcamp**](https://hlymrecords.bandcamp.com/album/stir) 

The second full-length album by the Limerick art-rock band Bleeding Heart Pigeons, containing a collection of introspective and sonically adventurous pop songs. My roles in the project were lead songwriter/composer, lead vocalist, guitarist, electronics, engineer and producer. The album was written and recorded while working with Virgin Records, and was self-released independently in 2020 after leaving the label.
