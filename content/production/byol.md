A lunchtime concert series hosted by Piquant Media, platforming a diverse array of Irish musicians in various venues in Limerick city. I handle live sound, sound recording, and post-production sound mixing/mastering for the project.

Through this project I have worked with Princâ‚¬ss, Mohammed Syfkhan, Baptist Goth (pictured), The Mary Wallopers, Poor Creature, Naive Ted, Maija Sofia, Hazey Haze + Citrus Fresh, I Dreamed I Dream, and His Father's Voice.
