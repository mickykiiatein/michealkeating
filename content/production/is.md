The debut album by art-rock band Bleeding Heart Pigeons, a 75-minute collection of songs based on existential themes. My roles in the project were lead songwriter/composer, lead vocalist, guitarist, engineer and producer. Released on Virgin Records UK, it was distributed worldwide, and led to the band supporting The Pixies, Beach House, Father John Misty, Villagers, Andrew Bird and others.
