The story is neither polished or neat, it is rough and taped together at the seams, fragmented and utterly incomplete.&#xA;Featuring performances from Denise Chaila, God Knows, Hey Rusty, His Father’s Voice, MuRli, and Post Punk Podge &amp;amp; the Technohippies, OUT OF PLACE is an intimate portrayal of a local music scene, capturing the incredible diversity of cultural activity happening in Limerick City.</description>
